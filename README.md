Hello, my name is Muhammad Ryan Maulana. I am a data analyst enthusiast. I enjoy diving into data to uncover hidden facts and trends with the goal of solving everyday problems and business challenges. Although I have a Bachelor's degree in Economics with a focus on management, I am always willing and continuously learning new things, including programming for data analytics. Feel free to use anything from my repositories and let's learn and grow together.
